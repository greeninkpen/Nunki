<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
*"GAME NAME"* is an interactive Language Learning Game that utilizes a sophisticated word generation API to enhance the understanding of different parts of speech in English. The app caters to individual learners and serves as a supplementary teaching tool for educators.


### Built With

It offers beginner (A1) level exercises where users practice recognizing parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, pronoun) within sentences generated by the API.

### Key Features
* Console-based front end
* API calls for sentences paired with their respective parts of speech (e.g., [cat, noun])
* Database integration for word storage
* Game logic for sentence-based activities with user input
* Inclusion of encouraging messages throughout the game
